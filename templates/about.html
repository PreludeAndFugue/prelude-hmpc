<p>
    A website for hosting photograph competitions. You need to
    <a href="/register">register</a> to compete.
</p>

<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>
    The first rule of <em>HMPC</em> is a  photograph must be taken during the
    month of the competition to which it is being submitted.
</p>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>You can add some mark-up to comments using the
    <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Markdown</a>
    format.
</p>

<p>
    To add links to your comments, you can either surround the link with angle
    brackets. This input
</p>
<pre>&lt;http://www.bbc.co.uk&gt;</pre>

<p>will produce this</p>

<pre><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">http://www.bbc.co.uk</a></pre>
<p>Or you can turn text into a link. This input</p>
<pre>[The BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk)</pre>

<p>will produce this</p>

<pre><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">The BBC</a></pre>

<p>To emphasise words, you can surround words with asterisks, like so:</p>

<pre>*single asterisks*
**double asterisks**
</pre>

<p>
    The submitted comment will then look like the following
    <pre><em>single asterisks</em>
<strong>double asterisks</strong></pre>
</p>
<p>
    There is much more to the markdown format, but this should be sufficient
    for our needs.
</p>
